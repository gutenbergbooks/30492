<h2>"MY CURATE."</h2>

<blockquote><p>[The <i>Law Times</i> mentions that a photograph of a well-dressed and
good-looking gentleman has been sent to it, with the words "My
Advocate" beneath. On the back are the name and address of a
Solicitor.]</p></blockquote>

<center><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Drowsiham Vicarage.</i> Vicar <i>and Family discovered seated at
breakfast-table. Time&mdash;Present.</i></center>

<p><i>The Vicar.</i> I only advertised for a Curate in last Saturday's <i>Church
Papers</i>, and already I have received more than sixty applications by the
post, all of them, apparently, from persons of the highest
respectability, whose views, too, happen to coincide entirely with my
own! Dear me! I suppose these may be called the "Clerical Unemployed."</p>

<p><i>Elder Daughter (giddily).</i> Pa! Have any of them sent photos?</p>

<p><i>Vicar.</i> Yes, all of them. It seems to be the new method to inclose
<i>cartes-de-visite</i> with testimonials.</p>

<p><i>Younger Daughter.</i> Now I shall be able to fill up my Album!</p>

<p><i>Elder Daughter (who has been running her eye over the pictures).</i> This
is the pick of the lot, Pa. Take him! Such a dear! He's got an eyeglass,
and whiskers, and curly hair, and seems quite young!</p>

<p><i>Younger Daughter (thoughtfully).</i> It's a pity we can't lay in <i>two</i>
Curates while we are about it.</p>

<p><i>Vicar.</i> Hem! A rather nice-looking young man, certainly. Let's see what
he says about himself. The new system saves a lot of trouble, as
candidates for posts write down their qualifications on the back of
their photographs.</p>

<p><i>Elder Daughter (reading).</i> "Views strictly orthodox." Oh, bother views!
Here's something better&mdash;"Very Musical Voice"&mdash;the <i>darling</i>! He <i>looks</i>
as if he had a musical voice. "Warranted not to go beyond fifteen
minutes in preaching." Delicious!</p>

<p><i>Vicar's Wife.</i> I don't know if the parishioners will like <i>that</i>.</p>

<p><i>Both Daughters (together).</i> But <i>we</i> shall!</p>

<p><i>Elder Daughter (continues reading).</i> "Quite content to preach only in
the afternoons. No attempts to rival Vicar's eloquence." What <i>does</i> he
mean?</p>

<p><i>Vicar (cordially).</i> I know! I think he'll do very well. <i>Just</i> the sort
of man I want!</p>

<p><i>Elder Daughter.</i> Ha! Listen to this! "Can play the banjo, and
twenty-six games of lawn-tennis without fatigue." The pet!</p>

<p><i>Younger Daughter.</i> Perfectly engaging! Oh, Pa, wire to him <i>at once</i>!</p>

<p><i>Elder Daughter (turning pale).</i> Stop! What is this? "Very steady and
respectable. <i>Has been engaged to be married for past three years!</i>"
Call <i>him</i> engaging, indeed! No chance of it. The wretch!</p>

<p><i>Younger Daughter.</i> A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing! Can't you prosecute him,
Pa?</p>

<p><i>Vicar (meditatively).</i> I might&mdash;in the Archbishop's Court. Really this
new self-recommendation plan, though useful in some ways, seems likely
to disturb quiet households. And I've fifty-nine more photos to look at!</p>

<h2>THE WAY TO THE TEMPLE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch,</span></p>

<center><i>Willesden Junction.</i></center>

<p>Having been assured by a Phrenologist that my bump of locality is very
highly developed, I attempted the other day&mdash;although a perfect stranger
to London&mdash;to walk from Charing Cross to the Temple without inquiring
the route. I had absolutely no assistance but a small map of Surbiton
and the neighbourhood, from which I had calculated the general lie of
the country, and a plain, ordinary compass, which I had bought cheap
because it had lost its pointer. I am not sure that the route I took was
the most direct. But when, after several hours' walk, I found myself at
Willesden Junction, I was assured by a boy in the district, whom I
asked, that I could not possibly have gone straighter. He advised me to
take a ticket at once for Chalk Farm, as I still had some way to go, and
said that he thought I might have to change at Battersea. He was a nice,
bright little boy, and laughed quite merrily.</p>

<p>I have now been at Willesden Junction for eighteen hours, and I have not
yet secured a train for Chalk Farm. There have been several, but they
have always gone from the platform which I had just left. So I have
camped out on the 101th platform, and I intend to stop there till a
train for Chalk Farm comes in. Of course the porters have remonstrated,
and tried to explain where and when the train really does start. But I
would sooner trust my natural instincts than any porter. That bright
little boy has been twice to see how I am getting on. He brought two
other boys last time. They all told me to stick to it, and seemed much
amused&mdash;probably at the stupidity of those porters. But really, <i>Mr.
Punch</i>, Willesden Junction ought to be simplified. It may be all very
well for me, with a phrenological aptitude for this sort of thing; but
these different levels, platforms, and stairs must be very puzzling to
less gifted people, such as the green young man from the country.</p>

<p>But the last suggestion which I have to make is the most important.
There ought to be a great many more doors <i>into</i> the refreshment-room,
and only one door out of it. I lost the thirteenth train for Chalk Farm
by going out of the wrong door. One door out would be ample, and it
should certainly be made&mdash;by an easy arrangement of pivots and pneumatic
pressure&mdash;to open straight into the train for anywhere where you wanted
to go. If this simple alteration cannot be made, Willesden Junction must
be destroyed at once, route and branch; or removed to Hampton Court, to
take the place of the present absurdly easy Maze. I am, <i>Mr. Punch</i>,</p>

<h2>MODERN TYPES.</h2>

No. VII.&mdash;THE PATRON OF SPORT.</center>

<p>In order to qualify properly for the patronage of sport, a man must
finally abandon any vestiges of refinement which may remain to him after
a youth spent mainly in the use of strong language, and the abuse of
strong drink. The future patron, who has enjoyed for some years the
advantages of a neglected training in the privacy of the domestic
circle, will have been sent to a public school. Like a vicious book, he
will soon have been "called in," though not until he has been cut by
those who may have been brought in contact with him. Having thus left
his school for his school's good, he will find no difficulty in
persuading his parents that the high spirits of an ingenuous youth,
however distasteful they may have been to the ridiculous prejudices of a
pedantic Head Master, are certain to be properly appreciated by the
officers of a crack Regiment. He will, therefore, decide to enter the
Army, and after pursuing his arduous studies for some time at the
various Music Halls and drinking saloons of the Metropolis, he will
administer a public reproof to the Civil Service Commissioners, by
declining on two separate occasions to pass the examination for
admission into Sandhurst.</p>

<p>He will then inform his father that he is heavily in debt, and, having
borrowed money from his tailor, he will disappear from the parental ken,
to turn up again, after a week, without his watch, his scarf-pin, or his
studs. This freak will be accepted by his relatives as a convincing
proof of his fitness for a financial career, and he will shortly be
transferred to the City as Clerk to a firm of Stockbrokers. Here his
versatile talents will have full scope. He will manage to reconcile a
somewhat lax attention to the details of business with a strict
regularity in his attendance at suburban race-meetings. Nothing will be
allowed to stand in his way when he pursues the shadow of pleasure
through the most devious windings into the lowest haunts. For him the
resources of dissipation are never exhausted. Pot-houses provide him
with cocktails, restaurants furnish him with elaborate dinners, tailors
array him in fine clothes, hosiers collar him up to the chin, and cover
his breast with immaculate fronts. The master-pieces of West-End
jewellers, hatters, and boot-makers, sparkle on various portions of his
person; he finds in a lady step-dancer a goddess, and in <i>Ruff's Guide</i>
a Bible; he sups, he swears, he drinks, and he gambles, and, finally, he
attains to the summit of earthly felicity by finding himself mentioned
under a nickname in the paragraphs of a sporting organ.</p>

<p>Having about the same time engaged in a midnight brawl with an
undersized and middle-aged cabman, he appears the next morning in a
Police Court, and, after being fined forty shillings, is hailed as a
hero by his companions, and recognised as a genuine Patron of Sport by
the world at large. Henceforward his position is assured. He becomes the
boon companion of Music-hall Chairmen, and lives on terms of intimate
vulgarity with Money-lenders, who find that it pays to take a low
interest in the pleasures, in order the more easily to obtain a high
interest on the borrowings, of reckless young men.</p>

<p>In company with these associates, and with others of more or less
repute, the Patron of Sport sets the seal to his patronage by becoming a
member of a so-called Sporting Club, at which professional pugilists
batter one another in order to provide excitement for a mixed assemblage
of coarse and brainless rowdies and the feeble toadies who dance
attendance upon them. Here the Patron is at his best and noblest. Though
he has never worn a glove in anger, nor indeed taken the smallest part
in any genuine athletic exercise, he is as free with his opinions as he
is unsparing of the adjectives wherewith he adorns them. He talks
learnedly of "upper-cuts" and "cross-counters," and grows humorous over
"mouse-traps," "pile-drivers on the mark," and "the flow of the ruby."
Having absorbed four whiskeys-and-soda, he will observe that "if a
fellow refuses to train properly, he must expect to be
receiver-general," and, after lighting his tenth cigar as a tribute,
presumably, to the lung power of the combatants, will indulge in some
moody reflections on the decay of British valour and the general
degeneracy of Englishmen. He will then drink liqueur brandy out of a
claret glass, and, having slapped a sporting solicitor on the back and
dug in the ribs a gentleman jockey who has been warned off the course,
he will tread on the toes of an inoffensive stranger who has allowed
himself to be elected a member of the Club under the mistaken impression
that it was the home of sportsmen and the sanctuary of honest boxers.
After duly characterising the stranger's eyes and his awkwardness, the
Patron will resume his seat near the ropes, and will stare vacuously at
the brilliant gathering of touts, loafers, parasites, usurers,
book-makers, broken-down racing men, seedy soldiers, and over-fed City
men who are assembled round the room. Inspired by their society with the
conviction that he is assisting in an important capacity in the revival
of a manly sport, he will adjust his hat on the back of his head, rap
with his gold-headed cane upon the floor, and call "Time!"&mdash;a humorous
sally which is always much appreciated, especially when the ring is
empty. After witnessing the first three rounds of the next competition,
he will rise to depart, and observing a looking-glass, will excite the
laughter of his friends and the admiration of the waiters by sparring
one round with his own reflection, finally falling into the arms of a
companion, whom he adjures not to mind him, but to sponge up the other
fellow.</p>

<p>After this exploit a supper-club receives him, and he is made much of by
those of both sexes who are content to thrive temporarily on the money
of a friend. He will then drive a hansom through the streets, and,
having knocked over a hot potato-stall, he will compensate the
proprietor with a round of oaths and a five-pound note.</p>

</div>

<p>In appearance the Patron of Sport is unwholesome. The bloom of youth
vanished from his face before he ceased to be a boy; he assumes the worn
and sallow mask of age before he has fairly begun to be a man. His hair
is thin, and is carefully flattened by the aid of unguents, his dress is
flashy, his moustache thick. In order the more closely to imitate a true
sportsman, he wears a baggy overcoat, with large buttons. Yet he abhors
all kinds of honest exercise, and, in the days of his prosperity, keeps
a small brougham with yellow wheels. Soon after he reaches the age of
thirty, he begins to feel the effects of his variegated life. He fails
in landing a big <i>coup</i> on the Stock Exchange, and loses much money over
a Newmarket meeting, in which he plunges on a succession of rank
outsiders, whom a set of rascals, more cunning than himself, have
represented to him as certainties. His position on the Stock Exchange
becomes shaky, and he attempts to restore it by embarking with a gang of
needy rogues on a first-class "roping" transaction, in connection with a
prize-fight in Spain. Having, however, been exposed, he is shunned by
most of those who only heard of the swindle when it was too late to join
in it.</p>

<p>This is the beginning of the end. He becomes careless of his appearance;
with the decrease of his means his coats become shiny, and his cuffs
more and more frayed. Eventually he falls into a state of sodden
imbecility, relieved by occasional flashes of delirium tremens, and dies
at the age of thirty-six, regretted by nobody except the faithful
bull-dog, whose silver collar was the last thing he pawned.</p>

<h2>PLAY-TIME.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the first night, if hearsay evidence can be accepted, as I didn't
see the <i>premi&egrave;re</i>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Sugden</span> must have immensely improved his
<i>Touchstone</i>. He plays it now with much dry, quaint humour, and when I
saw him in the part last week, every line told with a decidedly
discriminating but appreciative audience. His scenes with that capital
<i>Audrey</i>, Miss <span class="smcap">Marion Lea</span>, and with <i>William</i>, were uncommonly good. I
confess I was surprised. Mr. <span class="smcap">Bourchier</span>&mdash;but now an amateur, now
thus&mdash;gives <i>Jaques'</i> immortal speech of "All the world's a stage," in a
thoroughly natural and unconventional manner, chiefly remarkable for the
absence of every gesture or tone that could make it a mere theatrical
recitation by a modern professional reciter at a pic-nic. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Langtry's</span>
<i>Rosalind</i> is charming, her scenes with <i>Orlando</i> being as pretty a
piece of acting as any honest playgoer could wish to see. And what a
pretty Lamb is she they call <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> who plays <i>Ph&oelig;be</i>! What a
sweet, gentle, restful play it is! How unlike these bustling times! To
witness this idyllic romance as it is put on at the St. James's, is as
if one had stepped aside out of "the movement," had bid adieu for a
while to the madding crowd, and had plunged into the depths of the
forest of Arden, to find a tranquil "society of friends," among whom,
under the greenwood tree, one can rest and be thankful.</p>

<p>I was curious to see how <span class="smcap">Alexander</span> "the (Getting) Great" would comport
himself as the hero of light farce, associated as he has always hitherto
been with heroes of romance and high comedy. The theatre-going public
and his admirers&mdash;the terms are synonymous&mdash;may breathe again. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>
is surprisingly good as <i>Dr. Bill</i>, and the serious earnestness with
which he invests the part intensifies the drollery of the complications.
And to think that the adapter of this gay and festive piece should be
none other than the sentimental troubadour, song-writer and composer,
author of a Lyceum Tragedy and other similar trifles, Mr. <span class="smcap">Hamilton
A&iuml;d&eacute;</span>!! "Sir," in future will <span class="smcap">Hamilton A&iuml;d&eacute;</span> say, when being interviewed
by a Manager, "I will now read you my Five Act Tragedy entitled&mdash;&mdash;"
"Hang your tragedies!" will the Manager exclaim, "Give me a farce like
'<i>Dr. Bill</i>,' my boy!" And once more will the poet put his pride and his
tragedy in one pocket, and all the money which the Comic Muse will give
him in the other. I back the <i>argumentum ad pocketum</i> against the Tragic
Muse.</p>

<p>How capitally it is played! Miss <span class="smcap">Brough</span> excellent; and so also is Mr.
<span class="smcap">Chevalier</span>, who entirely loses his own identity in his make-up, and is
not to be recognised at all, save for a few mannerisms. Charming
housemaid is pretty Miss <span class="smcap">Marie Linden</span>; and the idiotic youth, <i>George
Webster</i>, played by Mr. <span class="smcap">Benjamin Webster</span>,&mdash;two Websters rolled into
one,&mdash;is very funny. But they're all as good as they can be. I
congratulate <span class="smcap">Alexander</span> the (Getting) Great, who, for pecuniary reasons,
I should like to be, were I not</p>

pastrycook's, cheesemonger's, or grocer's in the Three Kingdoms. A Noble
Earl having by an agreement with his head-keeper and chief tenants,
secured the right of shooting his own ground game, has commenced on his
own estate the manufacture, for which he has taken out patent rights, of
the above celebrated "rabbit" pies, the demand for which has so
increased that for the last six months his house has never contained a
shooting-party of less than ten guns at a time, that have all been
busily engaged at making a bag for their manufacture, continually, from
morning till night. An analyst, writing to the <i>Stethoscope</i>, says, "<i>I

<p><span class="smcap">Advice</span> to those who are about to give Easter presents&mdash;send to
<span class="smcap">Macmillan's</span> for "The Nursery 'Alice,'" who re-appears "as fresh as
paint," that is, with twenty-four of "Our Mr. <span class="smcap">Tenniel's</span>" illustrations,
coloured by Miss <span class="smcap">Gertrude Thomson</span>, under his direction.</p>

<p>The <i>Universal Review</i> is specially noteworthy for a short play by Mr.
<span class="smcap">W. L. Courtney</span>, entitled, <i>Kit Marlowe's Death</i>. Mr. <span class="smcap">Bourchier</span> of the
St. James's, so it is stated, is going to add this "Kit" to his
theatrical wardrobe. Some of the stage-directions,&mdash;such, for instance,
as "<i>They pour out wine in his cup, which he swallows</i>," and "<i>The
others laugh at</i> <span class="smcap">Nash's</span> <i>expense</i>,"&mdash;are well worth all the money that
the spirited purchaser may have paid for this almost priceless work. In
the same Magazine, the coloured frontispiece of "<i>Count Tolstoy at
Home</i>," showing the Count, not labouring in the fields of literature,
but simply guiding the plough, is as good as the article on the
<i>Kreutzer Sonata</i> is interesting; and interesting also is the paper
entitled, "Musings in an English Cathedral," by the Dean of
<span class="smcap">Gloucester</span>,&mdash;henceforth to be known as "A Musing Dean."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Andrew Lang</span> in <i>Longman's</i>&mdash;or rather <i>Lang-man's&mdash;Magazine</i>, is
still stopping at "The Sign of The Ship"&mdash;[The Baron moves "that the
words 'and Turtle' be inserted after 'Ship'"]&mdash;and as he has recently
been delighting us with wanders in the land of Ham, it will gratify his
readers to learn, that he is now ceasing to be "All for 'Hur,'" in order
to join the author of She in a plot for a new romance. They are
undeterred by the eye of Detective <span class="smcap">Runciman</span>. I wish success to Merry
Andrew Languid in this collaboration. In this same <i>Lang-man's Mag.</i>,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Val Prinsep</span>, A.R.A., having temporarily dissociated himself from the
paint-brush and canvas, by which he has made his name and fame,
continues his novel <i>Virginie</i>. In the present chapter he incidentally
gives a description of the service of Mass in the good <i>Abb&eacute; Leroux's</i>
parish church, which is a triumph of imagination and subtle humour. No
wonder "the <i>Abb&eacute; Leroux</i> was scandalised," when the service had been
turned topsy-turvy, the <i>credo</i> put before the <i>gloria</i>, and a young
person among his congregation, topping all other voices, was singing a
solo! Where was the Beadle? or a Churchwarden? or an Aggrieved
Parishioner? Three cheers for Facile <span class="smcap">Prinsep's</span> novel!</p>

<p>In <i>Plain Tales from the Hills</i>, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Rudyard Kipling</span>, the jaded
palate of the "General Reader" will recognise a new and piquant flavour.
In places the manner suggests an Anglo-Indian <span class="smcap">Bret Harte</span>, and there is
perhaps too great an abundance of phrases and local allusions which will
be dark sayings to the uninitiated. But the stories show a quite
surprising knowledge of life, a familiarity with military, civil, and
native society, and a command of pathos and humour, which have already
won a reputation for the author. Few can read <i>Beyond the Pale</i>, <i>The
Arrest of Lieutenant Golightly</i>, <i>The Story of Muhammed Din</i>, <i>The Germ
Destroyer</i>, and <i>The Madness of Private Ortheris</i>, for example, without
admiration for the versatility which can cover so wide a range, and
impress, amuse, or touch with the same ease and epigrammatic
conciseness.</p>

<p>I have just received <span class="smcap">Florian Pascal's</span> Music composed for <i>Tra la la
Tosca</i>, published by <span class="smcap">Joseph Williams</span> of Berners Street. Justice was not
done to it on the stage at the Royalty, but there are two <i>mor&ccedil;eaux</i> in
it which ought to become popular; one being a song entitled "<i>Her Eye</i>,"
which, were it wedded to serious words, would be highly popular as a
contralto song, just as <span class="smcap">Sullivan's</span> charming "<i>Hush a bye Bacon</i>," in
<i>Cox and Box</i>, became "<i>Birds of the Night</i>." Then the Gavotte in this
book is as graceful and catching as the <i>Gavotte de Louis Treize</i>, and
would be in great request with orchestras and bands everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Klein's</span> <i>Musical Notes of the Year</i>, a useful and trustworthy historical

but what I have ascertained is, that Mr. <span class="smcap">Edward Solomon</span>, who is now
wearing the diamond scarf-pin presented to him by the Guards whom he led

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<center>Extracted From the Diary of Toby, M.P.</center>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, March 24.</i>&mdash;Prince <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> explained in speech
nearly two hours long the bearings of Irish Land Purchase Bill. In
course of his exposition the happy accident by which civilised man is
furnished with two coat-tails was strikingly illustrated. On the
Treasury Bench, behind Prince <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>, sat, on either hand, <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span>
and <span class="smcap">Jokim</span>. Supposing the Prince had had only one coat-tail, differences
might have arisen between his two right hon. friends; sure at some
period of the prolonged speech to come into personal contact if both
pulling at same rope. But the liberal sartorial arrangements which
<span class="smcap">Arthur</span> shared in common with less distinguished Members provided a
coat-tail apiece; so when idea or suggestion occurred to him, <span class="smcap">Old
Morality</span> tugged at the right-hand one, and when <span class="smcap">Jokim</span> had a happy
thought he hauled away on the left.</p>

<p>As both their minds were seething with ideas, <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> had a lively time
of it, and complications of Bill grew in entanglement. Just as he was
assuming, for the sake of argument, that an advance of 30 millions had
been made under the Act for the Purchase of Land in Ireland, and that
seventeen years was about the average value under Lord <span class="smcap">Ashbourne's</span> Act,
there was a sudden tug of the right coat-tail; Prince leaned over in
that direction; <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>"Exactly!" said the Prince; "I was just going to show that the
instalment of 4 per cent. on the advance of 30 millions is &pound;1,200,000 a
year. Very well; suppose that in one year, though the hypothesis is
utterly impossible, that not one single sixpence of annuity is paid. How
would that be?" (Here the left coat-tail was observed to be violently
agitated, and <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> leaning over, <span class="smcap">Jokim</span> half-rising, eagerly explained
something.)</p>

<p>"Precisely. My right hon. friend reminds me, what indeed I was just
about to show, that there would be first the &pound;200,000 reserve fund;
secondly, there would be the &pound;200,000 annual probate grant; thirdly,
&pound;40,000 of the new Exchequer contribution, and &pound;75,000 of the quarter
per cent, local per-centage, and there would be besides that &pound;1,118,000
of tenants' reserve. So that without touching the &pound;5,000,000, which was
the landlords' fifth, and without touching a sixpence of the contingent
portion of the guarantee fund, you would have &pound;1,633,000 to meet the
call of &pound;1,200,000."</p>

<p>This prospect of boundless wealth, more especially the familiar way of
putting it, making it quite a personal matter for each Member that <i>he</i>
would have &pound;1,633,000 to meet a call of &pound;1,200,000, was designed to have
soothing effect on audience; would, indeed, have succeeded in that
direction but for the coat-tail accompaniment.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Jokim</span>," said <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>, "is too susceptible in his paternal feelings. We
know now who is the father of the progeny. Arranged that <span class="smcap">Balfour</span> shall
bring it in for christening ceremony; shall dandle it in his arms, and
dilate on its excellences; but everyone can tell from the excited
manner, the eager interruption, the restless hovering round the cradle,
that <span class="smcap">Jokim</span> is the father."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Land Purchase Bill brought in.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wilfrid Lawson</span> sprang a mine to-night. House, as everyone
knows, engaged for nearly fortnight in discussing question whether it
should thank Judges for their services in connection with Parnell
Commission. A desperate struggle finally resulted in decision to pass
Vote of Thanks. <span class="smcap">Lawson</span> wants to know whether <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> has conveyed
the thanks to the Judges; and if so, what had they said in reply?
Question put without notice. Rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> startles <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span>. Fact is,
never occurred to him that anything had to be done in supplement of
passing Vote of Thanks. There it was; Judges might, in passing, call in
and take it home with them; or it might be forwarded, at owner's risk,
by Parcel-Post or Pickford's. Very awkward thing thus springing these
questions on a Minister. Couldn't even, right off, say where the Vote of
Thanks was. Gazed hopelessly at mass of papers on Clerk's table. Might
probably be there. Perhaps not. Vote passed some days ago; desk cleared
every morning. <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> moved restlessly on bench; looked picture of
despair. Best thing to do, not to take notice of question; pretend not
to hear it; but House laughing and cheering; all eyes bent on him; no
escape. So, rising, holding on to table, putting on most diplomatic
manner, and speaking in solemn tones, <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> said, "Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>,
Sir, it is no part of my duty to the <span class="smcap">Queen</span> and country to convey to
anybody a Resolution of this House."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 20%">
<a href="images/168a.png">
<img src="images/168a.png" width="100%" alt="Where&#39;s the Vote of Thanks?" /></a>
<h4>"Where's the Vote of Thanks?"</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span> up again. More cheering and laughter. Asked <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> whether <i>he</i>
had conveyed Vote of Thanks to Judges? No; <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> had had no
instructions on the matter.</p>

<p>Where is the Vote of Thanks? Who has it in his possession? Certainly not
the Judges; one of those things nobody had thought about; various
people's business to see to it; accordingly no one done it; no wonder
Brother <span class="smcap">Day</span>, sitting on Bench, has looked forth with stony stare, his
heart consumed with secret sorrow. Whilst everyone congratulating Judges
on rare honour done to them by both Houses of Parliament, the
distinction has proved illusory. World pictured each learned Judge with
copy of Vote of Thanks, framed and glazed, hung in best parlour; and
behold! they have never had it at all!</p>

<p>House laughed when truth dawned upon it. But it was a hollow laugh,
ill-concealing prevalent feeling of vexation and shame-facedness. Turned
with affectation of keen interest to question raised by <span class="smcap">Mundella</span> of
iniquities of Education Department in connection with School Supply of
York and Salisbury. But could not keep the thing up. Even rousing
eloquence of <span class="smcap">Hart Dyke</span>, on his defence, fell flat. Ever rose before
Members the vision of the three Judges, daily expecting receipt of
thanks which they read had been voted to them; too proud to complain of
neglect; <span class="smcap">Hannen</span> taking on a sterner aspect; <span class="smcap">Smith</span> affecting a perky
indifference; and over the solemn features of Brother <span class="smcap">Day</span> ever stealing
the deepening twilight of deferred hope. House gladly broke away from
scene and subject, getting itself Counted Out at a Quarter-past Nine.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;"Talk about <span class="smcap">Dizzy</span>," said <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>, perhaps not without some
tinge of envy, "if <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> goes on in this style, <span class="smcap">Dizzy</span> won't be in
it for persiflage."</p>

<p>House laughing so heartily, could hardly hear <span class="smcap">Harcourt's</span> whisper. <span class="smcap">John
Morley</span> began it; Lunacy Laws Consolidation Bill with 342 Clauses and 5
Schedules gone through Committee like flash of lightning. Nothing been
seen like it since, the other night, I and seven other Members voted
Four Millions sterling in Committee on Navy Estimates. <span class="smcap">Courtney</span> put
Clauses in batches of fifty. No one said him nay. Natural supposition
was, that House in agreeing to this critical stage of important Bill
knew all about it. Every line of its 342 Clauses must be familiar to
every man present; otherwise how could he lay his hand on his heart, and
say, "Aye," when <span class="smcap">Courtney</span> asked him should he knock off another fifty
Clauses?</p>

<p>When it was over, <span class="smcap">John Morley</span> rose, and gravely expressed hope that <span class="smcap">Old
Morality</span> would inform his friends, accustomed to say that Opposition
persist in obstruction, how this piece of legislation had advanced by
leaps and bounds. This meant to be a nasty one for <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span>, prone
to go into the country in Autumn and protest how he is hampered in
performing duty to <span class="smcap">Queen</span> and country by obstruction of Members opposite.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" chuckled the Liberals, "<span class="smcap">John's</span> got him there. A hit, a
palpable hit!"</p>

<p>But no one yet fathomed the tranquil depths of <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span>. Rose from
other side of table and, with equal gravity, promised that he would tell
all his friends "how the Opposition had given greatest possible facility
for passing the Lunacy Bill." This joke one of kind whose exquisite
flavour evaporates on paper. But House enjoyed it immensely, none more
than <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span>. For an hour after, as he sat on Treasury Bench, his
face from time to time suddenly suffused with genial smile, and his
portly body gently shook with laughter.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said J. G. <span class="smcap">Talbot</span>, mournfully regarding him through his
spectacles; "he's thinking of the Old 'un," meaning the late joke.</p>

<p>Tithes Bill on for Second Reading. <span class="smcap">Picton</span> rallied scattered forces of

the sturdy salt brushed away the reluctant tear.</p>

Astonished and interested House to-night by vigorous speech delivered in

"meant to fight for Established Church till death." He put it to the
piratical <span class="smcap">Picton</span> and other marauders, whether, seeing that in such case
the conflict must necessarily be prolonged, they would not do well to
seize this opportunity of settling Tithe question?</p>

Mr. and Mrs. <span class="smcap">Madeira Top-floor Smithies</span> entertained a small and select
party at their new residence, The Hollies, 24A, Zanzibar Terrace,
Peckham Rye, East. Amongst those present we did not notice H.S.H. the
Prince of <span class="smcap">Teck</span>, the Duke of <span class="smcap">Westminster</span>, Lady <span class="smcap">Burdett-Coutts</span>, and the
<span class="smcap">Lord Chancellor</span>. In the general circle, Lord <span class="smcap">Cross</span>, the Countess of
<span class="smcap">Clarendon</span>, and the Bishop of <span class="smcap">London</span>, were also conspicuous by their
absence. It was rumoured that neither the Duke of <span class="smcap">Cambridge</span> nor Mr.
<span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> were expected to join the company before the close of the
entertainment."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dinner Scarcely &agrave; la Roose.</span>&mdash;Dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>,&mdash;I am a poor man, but I
like a nice dinner. Now I have discovered how to enjoy a good meal, and
yet keep the cost of living within reasonable limits. Here is my method.
I order and eat, a lobster, two pounds of pork chops, a large-sized pot
of <i>p&acirc;t&eacute; de foies gras</i>, a dressed crab, and three plates of toasted
cheese. Having finished this dainty little dinner, I find, that I can
eat nothing more for at least a week! That the pleasing fare does not
make me ill, is proved by my friends declaring that I look like a
picture of health. They do not say whether the picture is a good or bad
one&mdash;but that is a matter of detail.</p>

<p class="regards">Yours sincerely,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Utopian.</span>&mdash;Neither noise, vibration, nor dust! That's what the <span class="smcap">Bramwells</span>,
the <span class="smcap">Watkins</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Galtons</span> claim for that partly-developed but
promising&mdash;much promising&mdash;invention of M. <span class="smcap">Girard's</span>, the <i>Chemin de Fer
Glissant</i>, or Sliding Railway. <i>What</i> a happy ideal! By all means, "Let
it slide!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Chance for a New Member.</span>&mdash;"Rookeries," said Mr. <span class="smcap">Henry Lazarus</span> in his
evidence at Marylebone, "abound in St. Pancras, and it is a scandal to
civilisation that they should continue to exist." Now, Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolton</span>, M.P.,
can't you have your legal and parliamentary finger in this Rook pie?</p>
